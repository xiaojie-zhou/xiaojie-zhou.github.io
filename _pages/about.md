I am currently a Master of Science student in Computer Science at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu).

Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Information from [Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences](https://ics.uci.edu) at [University of California, Irvine (UCI)](https://uci.edu).

I enjoyed working with a diverse and collaborative team, and learned a lot from the mentors and managers. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to new challenges and opportunities, and contribute to the success of the organization.

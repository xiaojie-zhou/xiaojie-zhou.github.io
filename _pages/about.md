As a computer science student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu), I’m pursuing my master's degree after graduating from [UC Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu) with a bachelor's degree.

My passion would be to apply my technical skills solving real-world problems to improve efficiency. I’ve enjoyed working with a diverse and collaborative team and learnt a great deal from my mentors and managers. I’m eager to showcase my skills and knowledge facing new challenges, opportunities and contribute to the success of the organization.
